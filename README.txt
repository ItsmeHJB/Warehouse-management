How to run each task:
* Note: download and unzip the whole file structure in order to run the files *
* In the base folder should be the 4 warehouse files which have the start items,
  and the 4 shelves files which contain the shelf structure for every warehouse *

- Part 1:
    - Open ArtPart1.py from folder Part 1. Items.csv should be in folder Part 1 
	as well. Run this file. The item which cannot be added will be printed
	first. After any discards, the contents of the warehouses are printed out.
	- At the top of the file, the pseudo code is created in comments
- Part 2:
    - In folder Part 2, there should be a file called trips.csv, which contains
	all of the movements as from the specification. 
    - Part 2A is run from ArtPart2A.py, run this file to see what is moved on each
	trip, the total number of trips completed and the items which could not
	be moved.
    - Part 2B is run from ArtPart2B.py, this does the same thing, though now takes
	the total cost of all the items into account when transporting them 
- Part 3:
    - Open ArtPart3.py from the folder Part 3. In this folder, there should be 
	Part3Trips.csv as the trips file from BlackBoard. Run the python file.
	Once run, it will print out the items moved for each trip, and where
	the van has travelled on it's journey. After the trips, it will print
	out the rejected items.
- Part 4:
    - Open ArtPart4.py from the folder Part 4. In this folder, there should be
	Part4Trips.csv as the trips from Blackboard, like Part 3. Run the python 
	file. It will again, print out all the trips, what items were moved, the
	overall plan for where it went and the shapes it transferred together.
	At the end again it will print out the rejected items.
