£2b each warehouse
£8b total

Items have weight and shape
warehouses can store a certain number of each shape, where each item has a max weight, as well as total cost in a warehouse
Each warehouses has a certain number of spaces for different shapes
Once a space is taken,the weight cannot be made up elsewhere

ADD BREAKDOWN FOR 1)
	Check if there is a legitimate spot that can hold this new item I.E is it just too big to fit anywhere
	if :there is a spot in A
		store in A
	else:
		See if there is space in other warehouses
		if there is space in different warehouses:
			check for optimal weight usage
		if there is not space: 
			reject item

TO DO: (SEPERATE CODES)
	1)
	IMPLEMENT pseudo-code and code to do:
		add item to warehouseA
		if can't be stored:
			move to another warehouse based on shape
			or optimal weight usage
		if move can't be done -> reject
		(cost will always be considered)
		
	2)
	THERE IS A van
		van can do 1 trip per day, from one warehouse to another
		van weight limit = 2 ton
			ignoring weight and shape of items, plan how long it will take to move everything
			max insurance on van is £1.5bn, then take weight and cost of items and recalculate
			
	3)
	New data, with a new van
		van can reach 2 warehouses, but can only travel A -> B -> C -> D but can relocate overnight
		(van can travel A -> C for example)
		calculate minimum trips to with weight and cost considered
		
	4)
	Do it again, but they all have to be the same shape this time
	weight limit = 2 ton and cost £1.5bn again
